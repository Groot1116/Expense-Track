# Expense-Track

A project that where I learn how to connect programming languages with another. I want to create an embedded webserver and have HTML/web based interface for the front end and c++ for the backend. It's about a expense tracker because I want to manage my spending better instead of betting all on black.

going to do more updates soon...
